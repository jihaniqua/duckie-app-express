## Assignment 2 - Project Plan
### Purpose of this application
My application is designed for parents looking for one place to manage various aspects of their child’s life—saving milestones, archiving art project images, documenting medical information, accessing extracurriculars and school schedules, and writing journal entries for their children to read in the future. The app holds essential information and memories, which creates a digital time capsule for parents to reminisce about and share with their children in the future.

### Why it is useful
This application is convenient for parents and guardians to save and revisit all child-related information in one place. My goals for my application include simplifying document management by saving time which would otherwise be spent searching for or managing scattered records, and preserving memories that would be nice to look back to whenever they want.

### Possible additional features
Since I’ve done the same application for our ASP.NET class where I made journals and milestones, this time around, I want to make a medical information page and an art projects gallery. I want to add vaccination or check-up reminders as additional features for the medical information page.

List if npm packages I’m considering using:
Cron - for scheduling and reminders
Puppeteer - for generating PDF files from JSON data
Multer - for uploading images and downloading files
